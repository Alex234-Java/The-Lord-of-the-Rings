# The-Lord-of-the-Rings
This is my first project made in Java 11./n
It's a non-interactive game where the player has to create one army of heroes and one army of beasts(you can choose their life and armor and their type)/
and after pressing the fight button the armies will fight following an algorithm which will draw a random number representing their attack for each character.
The algorithm is made so the heroes have a better chance of drawing a bigger attack number.
The type of the character matters too:
    -The Elves hate the Orics so they do 10 more damage to them.
    -The Hobits fears the Goblins so much that they lose 5 damage when attacking a goblin.
    -The Orcs have so much power that any enemy loses 10% of their armor when fighting and orc.
